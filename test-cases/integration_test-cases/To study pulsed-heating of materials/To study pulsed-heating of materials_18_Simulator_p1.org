* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “To study pulsed-heating of materials” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study pulsed-heating of materials/To study pulsed-heating of materials_01_Usability_smk.org][To study pulsed-heating of materials_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Select the type of material,state and Heat Energy from the dropdown list present at the respective fields
  5. Click on the output button
  6. Click on the Play button
  7. Click on the ON button and  click on the OFF button
  8. Click on the close button
  9. Click on the graph button and the click on the close button
  10. Click on the reload button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. Selected material,state and Heat Energy should be displayed on the screen
  5. The output values should be displayed on the screen
  6. A popup window should be displayed on the screen with the simulation process
  7. When we click on the ON button the the presentation should should start playing the video and then when we click on the OFF button the presentation should get stopped
  8. When we click on the close button, the popup window should get closed
  9. A popup window should be displayed on the screen with the grapghs between energy vs volume and when we click on the close button, the popup window should get closed
  10. All the entered values should be erased from the corresponding fields
