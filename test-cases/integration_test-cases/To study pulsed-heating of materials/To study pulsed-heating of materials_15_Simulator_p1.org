* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “To study pulsed-heating of materials” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study pulsed-heating of materials/To study pulsed-heating of materials_01_Usability_smk.org][To study pulsed-heating of materials_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Don't select the type of material,state and Heat Energy from the dropdown list present at the respective fields
  5. Click on the output button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to select the material,state and Heat Energy from the dropdown list present at the respective fields
