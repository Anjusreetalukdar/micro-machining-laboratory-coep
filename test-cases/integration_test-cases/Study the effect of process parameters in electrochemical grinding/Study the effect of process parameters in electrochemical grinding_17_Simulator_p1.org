* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “Study the effect of process parameters in electrochemical grinding ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Study the effect of process parameters in electrochemical grinding/Study the effect of process parameters in electrochemical grinding_01_Usability_smk.org][Study the effect of process parameters in electrochemical grinding_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Select 'Effect of current density on MRR' displayed on the screen
  5. Select the Current Density value from the dropdown list displayed on the screen at the corresponding field
  6. Select Material removal rate type and click on the appropriate radio button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. The simulation result should be displayed on the screen

* Review/comments
