* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system/Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org][Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Select the Type of State,Power and Spotsize from the dropdown list present at the respective fields
  5. Click on the output button
  6. click on the reload button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. Selected Type of State,Power and Spotsize should be displayed on the screen
  5. The output values should be displayed on the screen
  6. All the entered values should be erased from the corresponding fields
