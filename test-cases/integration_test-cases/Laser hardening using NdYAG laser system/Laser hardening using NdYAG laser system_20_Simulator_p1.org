* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system/Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org][Laser hardening using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Don't select the Type of State, and select the Power and Spotsize from the dropdown list present at the corresponding field and vice-versa
  5. Click on the output button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to select theType of State from the dropdown list present at the corresponding fields and vice-versa
