* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “To study influence of process parameters on the Wire EDM ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study influence of process parameters on the Wire EDM /To study influence of process parameters on the Wire EDM _01_Usability_smk.org][To study influence of process parameters on the Wire EDM _01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Don't select the trail value from the dropdown list present at the corresponding field
  5. Click on the output button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to select the trail value from the dropdown list present at the corresponding fields
