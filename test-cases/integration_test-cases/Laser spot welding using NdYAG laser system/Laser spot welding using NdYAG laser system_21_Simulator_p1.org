* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system/Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org][Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Select 'Beam power' option and click on the appropriate radio button
  5. Select the value of beam power from the dropdown list displayed on the screen
  6. Click on the output button.
  7. Click on the Play button
  8. Click on the start button and  click on the pause button and click on play button
  9. Click on the close button
  10. Click on the graph button and the click on the close button
  11. Click on the reload button
  12. Select the 'Beam spot size' option and click on the appropriate radio button
  13. Repeat 5,6,7,8,9,10&11 steps

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. Selected 'beam power' value should be displayed on the screen
  5. The output values should be displayed on the screen
  6. A popup window should be displayed on the screen with the simulation process
  7. When we click on the 'start' button the the presentation should should start playing the video and then when we click on the 'pause' button the presentation should get paused and when we click on the play button the presentation should start playing
  8. When we click on the close button, the popup window should get closed
  9. A popup window should be displayed on the screen with the grapghs between energy vs volume and when we click on the close button, the popup window should get closed
  10. All the entered values should be erased from the corresponding fields
