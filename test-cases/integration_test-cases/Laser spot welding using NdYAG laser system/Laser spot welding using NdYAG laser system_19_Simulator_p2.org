* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system/Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org][Laser spot welding using NdYAG laser system_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Select 'Beam power' option and click on the appropriate radio button
  5. Don't select the value of beam power from the dropdown list displayed on the screen and click on the output button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to select a value of beam power from the dropdown list present at the corresponding fields
