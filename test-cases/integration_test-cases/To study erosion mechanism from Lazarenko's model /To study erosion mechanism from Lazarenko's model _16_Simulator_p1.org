* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “To study erosion mechanism from Lazarenko's model” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/To study erosion mechanism from Lazarenko's model /To study erosion mechanism from Lazarenko's model _01_Usability_smk.org][To study erosion mechanism from Lazarenko's model _01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Don't select the type of material and select the constant parameter from the dropdown list present at the corresponding fields and vice-versa
  5. Click on the output button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to select the material from the dropdown list present at the corresponding fields and vice-versa
