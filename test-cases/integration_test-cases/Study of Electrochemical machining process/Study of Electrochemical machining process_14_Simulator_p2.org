* Objective
  - To Perform the simulation of  “Study of Electrochemical machining process ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/micro-machining-laboratory-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Study of Electrochemical machining process/Study of Electrochemical machining process_01_Usability_smk.org][Study of Electrochemical machining process_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the 'Click here for Simulation' link
  4. Select type of Metal from the drop down list displayed on the screen
  5. Select type of valency from the drop down list displayed on the screen
  6. Select Removal Rate type and click on the appropriate radio button
  7. Click on the power supply button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process
  4. The simulation result should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the power supply button, the presentation should start playing
